# Sanitization System Update Summary

## Overview

Updated the sanitization system to use a **whitelist approach** that only includes files from `quartz/` and `api/` directories, with enhanced warnings before pushing to the public repository.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Whitelist Approach

- **Before**: Excluded specific files/directories from a comprehensive list
- **After**: Only includes files from `quartz/` and `api/` directories plus essential config files
- **Result**: Much cleaner and more predictable sanitization

### 2. Enhanced Warnings

- **Before**: Simple confirmation prompt
- **After**: Comprehensive warning with clear breakdown of what's included/excluded
- **Features**:
  - Visual separators and emojis for clarity
  - Detailed list of included/excluded directories
  - Explicit confirmation requiring "yes" (not just Enter)
  - Clear explanation of the source-only nature

### 3. Updated File Selection Logic

```typescript
// New approach in copyFilesSelectively()
const includeFiles = [
  "package.json",
  "package-lock.json",
  "quartz.config.ts",
  "quartz.layout.ts",
  "tsconfig.json",
  "globals.d.ts",
  "index.d.ts",
  "README.md",
  ".gitignore",
  ".gitattributes",
  ".prettierrc",
  ".prettierignore",
  "Dockerfile",
]

const quartzIncludeDirs = [
  "quartz/bootstrap-*.mjs",
  "quartz/build.ts",
  "quartz/cfg.ts",
  "quartz/worker.ts",
  "quartz/cli/**/*",
  "quartz/components/**/*",
  "quartz/i18n/**/*",
  "quartz/plugins/**/*",
  "quartz/processors/**/*",
  "quartz/static/**/*",
  "quartz/styles/**/*",
  "quartz/util/**/*",
]

const apiIncludeDirs = ["api/**/*"]
```

### 4. Updated Configuration

- **sanitize-config.json**: Updated commit message to reflect new approach
- **Enhanced .gitignore**: Updated to reflect source-only nature
- **Commit messages**: Now clearly indicate "quartz/ and api/ directories only"

## What's Included in Public Repo

### ‚úÖ Included Directories

- `quartz/` - Complete Quartz framework source code
- `api/` - API-related files
- Essential config files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)

### ‚ùå Excluded Directories

- `content/` - All personal content and blog posts
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts and tools
- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `tests/` - Test files
- `public/` - Build artifacts
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies
- `.quartz-cache/` - Build cache
- All other directories and files

## Warning System

### Standard Mode Warning

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: ABOUT TO PUSH TO PUBLIC REPOSITORY
================================================================================

üö® IMPORTANT:
   ‚Ä¢ This will push ONLY quartz/ and api/ directories
   ‚Ä¢ ALL content, scripts, docs, and other files will be EXCLUDED
   ‚Ä¢ This is a SOURCE-ONLY repository
   ‚Ä¢ No personal content, drafts, or private files will be included

üìÅ What's being included:
   ‚úÖ quartz/ (Quartz framework source code)
   ‚úÖ api/ (API-related files)
   ‚úÖ Essential config files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)

üìÅ What's being EXCLUDED:
   ‚ùå content/ (all your content)
   ‚ùå scripts/ (utility scripts)
   ‚ùå docs/ (documentation)
   ‚ùå tests/ (test files)
   ‚ùå public/ (build artifacts)
   ‚ùå node_modules/ (dependencies)
   ‚ùå .quartz-cache/ (build cache)

üéØ Target: git@github.com:samlazrak/Digital-Garden.git
üìä Result: Clean source-only repository

================================================================================

ü§î Are you SURE you want to push to the public repository? (yes/NO):
```

### Fast Mode Warning

- Similar comprehensive breakdown
- Optimized for quick review and confirmation
- Uses "y/N" prompt for faster interaction

## Testing

### Test Command

```bash
# Dry run test
npx tsx scripts/sanitize.ts --dry-run

# Fast mode test
npx tsx scripts/sanitize.ts --fast --dry-run

# Full test
npx tsx scripts/test-sanitization.ts
```

### Expected Output

- 227 files included (quartz/ + api/ + config files)
- Clear breakdown of included directories
- No content, scripts, or docs included
- Comprehensive warnings before pushing

## Benefits

1. **Predictability**: Clear whitelist approach eliminates uncertainty
2. **Security**: No risk of accidentally including sensitive content
3. **Clarity**: Explicit warnings show exactly what will be pushed
4. **Maintainability**: Simpler logic, easier to understand and modify
5. **Safety**: Requires explicit "yes" confirmation, not just Enter

## Usage

```bash
# Standard sanitization with warnings
npx tsx scripts/sanitize.ts

# Fast mode (skips detailed confirmation)
npx tsx scripts/sanitize.ts --fast

# Dry run (no actual push)
npx tsx scripts/sanitize.ts --dry-run

# Debug mode (shows commit message processing)
npx tsx scripts/sanitize.ts --debug
```

## Files Modified

1. `scripts/sanitize.ts` - Main sanitization logic
2. `scripts/sanitize-config.json` - Configuration updates
3. `scripts/test-sanitization.ts` - Test file for verification
4. `docs/sanitization-update-summary.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps

1. Test the sanitizer with actual push to verify behavior
2. Monitor the public repository to ensure only intended files are included
3. Update documentation if needed based on real-world usage
4. Consider adding more granular control if needed in the future
