# Projects & Community Work

I believe technology is most powerful when it serves community needs and is developed through collaborative, inclusive processes. My work focuses on building tools that solve real problems while fostering local tech ecosystems and knowledge sharing.

## Current Projects

- [[projects/Build Birmingham]] - Community development and open-source collaboration in Birmingham's tech ecosystem
