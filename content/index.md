## What is a Digital Garden? ðŸŒ±

A digital garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organized by publication date like a blog. Instead, they're organized by context and relationships, growing and changing over time like a real garden.

Unlike traditional blogs:
- **Notes evolve**: Ideas are continuously refined and updated
- **Non-linear**: Explore through connections, not chronology
- **Learn in public**: Share thoughts as they develop, not just polished final products
- **Interconnected**: Topics link together creating a web of knowledge

This garden contains my explorations in AI, medicine, art, and technology - all growing and intertwining as I learn.
