Over the past few years, I've had the incredible opportunity to work on various computer vision projects leveraging NVIDIA's GPU ecosystem. From real-time object detection to neural rendering, these projects have pushed the boundaries of what's possible with modern AI.

## Real-Time Object Detection with TensorRT

One of my most impactful projects involved optimizing a YOLOv8 model for real-time detection in industrial settings. Using NVIDIA's TensorRT, we achieved:

- **95% reduction** in inference time (from 50ms to 2.5ms per frame)
- **4K resolution** processing at 60 FPS on a single RTX 4090
- **INT8 quantization** with minimal accuracy loss (<1% mAP drop)

The key breakthrough came from implementing custom CUDA kernels for our specific use case, which eliminated unnecessary memory transfers and maximized GPU utilization.

```python
# Example TensorRT optimization pipeline
import tensorrt as trt

def optimize_model(onnx_path, precision='fp16'):
    builder = trt.Builder(logger)
    config = builder.create_builder_config()
    
    if precision == 'int8':
        config.set_flag(trt.BuilderFlag.INT8)
        config.int8_calibrator = CustomCalibrator(calibration_data)
    
    # Enable DLA for Jetson platforms
    if platform == 'jetson':
        config.DLA_core = 0
```

## Neural Radiance Fields on Mobile GPUs

Working with NVIDIA's mobile GPU team, I contributed to bringing NeRF technology to edge devices. Our implementation on Jetson Orin achieved:

- Real-time rendering (30 FPS) of complex 3D scenes
- 80% memory footprint reduction through novel compression
- Custom CUDA graph optimizations for mobile architectures

This project opened doors for AR/VR applications that were previously impossible on mobile hardware.

## Multi-Camera 3D Reconstruction Pipeline

For autonomous vehicle research, I developed a multi-camera fusion system that processes 8 simultaneous camera feeds:

### Technical Architecture:
- **NVIDIA DeepStream** for video ingestion and preprocessing
- **Custom CUDA kernels** for geometric transformations
- **cuDNN-accelerated** depth estimation networks
- **Unified memory** architecture for zero-copy processing

The system generates dense 3D point clouds at 20 Hz, enabling real-time navigation decisions.

## Synthetic Data Generation with Omniverse

One of the most exciting projects involved using NVIDIA Omniverse for generating photorealistic training data:

- Created **1M+ synthetic images** with perfect ground truth
- Reduced data collection costs by **90%**
- Improved model generalization through domain randomization

```python
# Omniverse Replicator example
import omni.replicator.core as rep

with rep.new_layer():
    # Randomize lighting conditions
    light = rep.create.light(
        light_type="dome",
        intensity=rep.distribution.uniform(1000, 5000)
    )
    
    # Apply random materials and textures
    rep.randomizer.materials(
        materials=material_library,
        seed=42
    )
```

## GPU-Accelerated Video Analytics

Developed a distributed video analytics platform processing 1000+ concurrent streams:

### Performance Metrics:
- **10x throughput** improvement over CPU baseline
- **<100ms latency** for critical alerts
- **99.9% uptime** in production deployment

The secret sauce was implementing a custom batch processing pipeline that maximized GPU occupancy while minimizing memory transfers.

## Lessons Learned

Through these projects, I've discovered several key insights:

1. **Hardware-Software Co-design**: Understanding GPU architecture is crucial for optimization
2. **Memory is King**: Most bottlenecks come from data movement, not computation
3. **Profile Everything**: NVIDIA Nsight tools are invaluable for identifying performance issues
4. **Start Simple**: Begin with reference implementations, then optimize incrementally

## Future Explorations

I'm currently exploring:
- **Vision Transformers** optimization for edge deployment
- **Federated learning** on distributed GPU clusters  
- **Neural video compression** using NVENC/NVDEC APIs
- **Real-time style transfer** for creative applications
