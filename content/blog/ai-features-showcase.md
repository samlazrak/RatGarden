Today I'm excited to showcase the comprehensive AI features that power this digital garden. These aren't just technical experiments – they're practical tools designed to enhance how you discover, create, and interact with content.

## 🔍 AI-Powered Semantic Search

Gone are the days of keyword-only search. Our new semantic search understands context and meaning:

- **Hybrid Search Modes**: Switch between keyword, semantic, and hybrid search
- **Real-time Embeddings**: Content is vectorized for similarity matching
- **Contextual Results**: Find related content even without exact matches

Try searching for concepts rather than keywords – you'll be amazed at what surfaces!

## 🎯 Personalized Content Recommendations

The AI recommendation engine learns from your browsing patterns:

### Three Modes:
1. **Related Content**: Finds similar articles based on current page
2. **Personalized**: Adapts to your reading history and preferences
3. **Trending**: Surfaces popular and recently updated content

All personalization happens locally in your browser – your data never leaves your device.

## ✍️ AI Writing Assistant

Transform your writing with our floating AI assistant:

- **Grammar & Style Check**: Real-time suggestions for clarity
- **Content Suggestions**: Get ideas to expand your thoughts
- **Smart Completion**: Let AI help finish your sentences
- **Text Summarization**: Condense long content instantly

Access it anytime via the floating button in the corner!

## 🎮 Interactive AI Demos

Experience AI capabilities firsthand with our browser-based demos:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understand emotional tone in text
- **Image Classification**: See computer vision in action  
- **Text Generation**: Create content with AI assistance
