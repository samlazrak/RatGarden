# Art & Creative Works

This section showcases my artistic endeavors, which blend traditional artistic techniques with computational methods and interdisciplinary thinking. My work explores the intersection of technology, craft, and human expression.

## Artistic Philosophy

Art has always been my space for exploring ideas that don't fit neatly into disciplinary boxes. My background in technology and philosophy naturally flows into my creative work, where I find unexpected connections between ancient crafts and cutting-edge computational methods. There's something profound about working with both code and clay, pixels and paper—each medium teaches different lessons about form, structure, and meaning.

I'm fascinated by how algorithms can become brushes and data can become pigment. Computational aesthetics isn't about replacing traditional art forms; it's about expanding our creative vocabulary. When I engage with historical artistic traditions—whether through bookbinding techniques or classical composition principles—I'm not trying to recreate the past but to understand how these time-tested approaches can inform contemporary digital practice.

## Media & Techniques

- **Mixed Media**: Combining traditional materials with digital elements
- **Book Arts**: Creating artist books, paper engineering, and bibliographic objects
- **Computational Art**: Algorithmic generation, data visualization, and interactive media
- **Installation**: Site-specific works that engage space and audience

## Themes

My work often explores:
- The relationship between information and physical form
- Historical continuities in knowledge transmission
- The materiality of digital culture
- Embodied cognition and sensory experience

*Art serves as a space for experimentation and reflection, allowing for exploration of ideas that transcend disciplinary boundaries and engage with fundamental questions about knowledge, experience, and expression.*
