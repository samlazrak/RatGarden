# Art & Creative Works

This section showcases my artistic endeavors, which blend traditional artistic techniques with computational methods and interdisciplinary thinking. My work explores the intersection of technology, craft, and human expression.

## Artistic Philosophy

My creative practice is informed by:
- **Interdisciplinary Exploration**: Drawing connections between technology, philosophy, and traditional crafts
- **Material Investigation**: Working with both physical and digital media to explore form and meaning
- **Computational Aesthetics**: Using algorithms and data as creative tools and conceptual frameworks
- **Historical Dialogue**: Engaging with historical artistic traditions while exploring contemporary possibilities

## Media & Techniques

- **Mixed Media**: Combining traditional materials with digital elements
- **Book Arts**: Creating artist books, paper engineering, and bibliographic objects
- **Computational Art**: Algorithmic generation, data visualization, and interactive media
- **Installation**: Site-specific works that engage space and audience

## Themes

My work often explores:
- The relationship between information and physical form
- Historical continuities in knowledge transmission
- The materiality of digital culture
- Embodied cognition and sensory experience
