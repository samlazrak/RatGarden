Welcome to our interactive AI demo gallery! These demos run directly in your browser, showcasing various AI capabilities without requiring any setup or installation.

## Natural Language Processing

Analyze the sentiment and emotional tone of any text using our NLP model:

{{< InteractiveAIDemo demoType="nlp" >}}

Try analyzing different types of text - from product reviews to social media posts. The model can detect positive, negative, and neutral sentiments with high accuracy.

## Computer Vision

Upload an image and see how AI classifies it:

{{< InteractiveAIDemo demoType="vision" >}}

Our vision model can recognize thousands of different objects, animals, and scenes. Try uploading various images to see how it performs!

## Text Generation

Experience the creative power of AI text generation:

Start with a prompt and watch as the AI continues your text in creative and unexpected ways. Perfect for brainstorming or overcoming writer's block!

## How These Demos Work

These interactive demos leverage several cutting-edge technologies:

1. **WebAssembly** - Enables near-native performance in the browser
2. **WebGPU** - Accelerates AI computations using your GPU
3. **Transformers.js** - Brings state-of-the-art models to the browser
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Falls back gracefully on unsupported devices

### Technical Details

- Models are downloaded and cached locally for offline use
- All processing happens in your browser - no data is sent to servers
- Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- Uses quantized models for faster inference
