# Testing Medical Citations Component

This page demonstrates the MedicalCitations component using real healthcare AI research papers from various sources, including datasets mentioned in the [Awesome Healthcare Datasets](https://github.com/geniusrise/awesome-healthcare-datasets) repository.

## Overview

The citations below represent key research in healthcare AI, covering:
- Computer vision for medical imaging [1]
- AI in drug discovery [2]
- Ethical guidelines for healthcare AI [3]
- Clinical implementation case studies [4]

## Key Findings from Literature

### Medical Imaging AI
The CheXNeXt algorithm [1] demonstrated that deep learning models can match or exceed radiologist performance in detecting certain pathologies from chest X-rays. This research used the CheXNet dataset, one of the largest publicly available chest X-ray datasets.

### Drug Discovery Applications
Paul et al. [2] provide a comprehensive review of how AI is transforming drug discovery pipelines, reducing time and costs for bringing new medications to market.

### Ethical Considerations
The WHO guidance [3] establishes six key principles for ethical AI in healthcare:
1. Protecting autonomy
2. Promoting human well-being and safety
3. Ensuring transparency
4. Fostering responsibility and accountability
5. Ensuring inclusiveness and equity
6. Promoting responsive and sustainable AI

### Real-World Implementation
The sepsis detection case study [4] shows practical challenges and solutions when deploying ML models in clinical settings, achieving a 58% reduction in sepsis-related mortality.

## Testing Features

### Citation Formatting
Notice how the component:
- Displays different citation types with color coding
- Shows truncated author lists with "et al." for readability
- Provides direct links to DOI and PubMed
- Numbers citations for easy reference

### Inline References
You can reference citations inline like this [1], and clicking should scroll to the citation below. Multiple references [2,3] can be used in one sentence.

### Clinical Note Integration
The citation system works alongside clinical note templates, allowing evidence-based documentation with proper references [4].

## Data Sources

These citations were selected from papers that utilize or discuss various healthcare datasets including:
- **MIMIC-III**: Critical care database used in sepsis detection research
- **CheXNet**: Chest X-ray dataset for pneumonia detection
- **FDA Adverse Event Reporting**: Drug safety monitoring
- **Clinical trial registries**: For evidence-based guidelines

## Conclusion

The MedicalCitations component successfully handles various citation types and provides a clean, academic interface for referencing medical literature. The integration with healthcare datasets demonstrates its utility for evidence-based clinical documentation and research presentation.
