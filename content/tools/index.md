# Tools & Technologies

This section covers my work with digital tools, software development projects, and technical explorations. It reflects my ongoing engagement with emerging technologies and their practical applications.

## Technical Philosophy

Technology should amplify human capabilities, not replace human judgment. This principle guides everything I build. Rather than creating tools for their own sake, I focus on understanding real problems that people face and developing solutions that meaningfully improve their work or lives.

Working with AI has taught me that the most powerful systems are also the most responsible ones. Privacy, bias mitigation, and social impact aren't afterthoughts—they're fundamental design considerations from day one. I've seen firsthand how AI can perpetuate existing inequalities when we're not careful, which is why ethical development practices are non-negotiable in my work.

I'm a strong advocate for open standards because technology should connect us, not create new silos. Interoperability and accessibility ensure that the tools we build today will continue serving communities tomorrow. And in a field that evolves as rapidly as ours, maintaining a learner's mindset isn't optional—it's essential. I stay current with emerging technologies while always questioning their broader implications and potential impacts.

## Areas of Focus

### Artificial Intelligence
- Machine learning applications for healthcare and research
- Natural language processing and semantic analysis
- Privacy-preserving AI systems
- Responsible AI development practices

### Web Technologies
- Full-stack application development
- User experience design and accessibility
- Modern JavaScript frameworks and backend systems
- Progressive web applications

### Computational Methods
- Data analysis and visualization
- Algorithm design and optimization
- Scientific computing applications
- Digital humanities tools

### Development Practices
- Test-driven development and quality assurance
- DevOps and deployment automation
- Code review and collaborative development
- Documentation and knowledge sharing
