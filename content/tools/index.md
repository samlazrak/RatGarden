# Tools & Technologies

This section covers my work with digital tools, software development projects, and technical explorations. It reflects my ongoing engagement with emerging technologies and their practical applications.

## Technical Philosophy

My approach to technology development emphasizes:
- **Purpose-Driven Development**: Building tools that solve real problems and serve human needs
- **Ethical AI**: Developing artificial intelligence systems with consideration for privacy, bias, and social impact
- **Open Standards**: Supporting interoperable, accessible, and sustainable technology
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying current with evolving technologies while maintaining critical perspective

## Areas of Focus

### Artificial Intelligence
- Machine learning applications for healthcare and research
- Natural language processing and semantic analysis
- Privacy-preserving AI systems
- Responsible AI development practices

### Web Technologies

- User experience design and accessibility
- Modern JavaScript frameworks and backend systems
- Progressive web applications

### Computational Methods
- Data analysis and visualization
- Algorithm design and optimization
- Scientific computing applications
- Digital humanities tools

### Development Practices
- Test-driven development and quality assurance
- DevOps and deployment automation
- Code review and collaborative development
- Documentation and knowledge sharing
