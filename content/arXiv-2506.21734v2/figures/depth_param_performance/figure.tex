\caption{\textbf{The necessity of depth for complex reasoning.} \textbf{Left:} On \textit{Sudoku-Extreme Full}, which require extensive tree-search and backtracking, increasing a Transformer's width yields no performance gain, while increasing depth is critical. \textbf{Right:} Standard architectures saturates, failing to benefit from increased depth. HRM overcomes this fundamental limitation, effectively using its computational depth to achieve near-perfect accuracy.}
