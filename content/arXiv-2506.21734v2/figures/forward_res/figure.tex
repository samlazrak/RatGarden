\caption{Comparison of forward residuals and PCA trajectories. HRM shows hierarchical convergence: the H-module steadily converges, while the L-module repeatedly converges within cycles before being reset by H, resulting in residual spikes. The recurrent neural network exhibits rapid convergence with residuals quickly approaching zero. In contrast, the deep neural network experiences vanishing gradients, with significant residuals primarily in the initial (input) and final layers.}
