  \caption{\textbf{Left:} HRM is inspired by hierarchical processing and temporal separation in the brain. It has two recurrent networks operating at different timescales to collaboratively solve tasks. \textbf{Right:} With only about 1000 training examples, the HRM (\textasciitilde27M parameters) surpasses state-of-the-art CoT models on inductive benchmarks (ARC-AGI) and challenging symbolic tree-search puzzles (\textit{Sudoku-Extreme}, \textit{Maze-Hard}) where CoT models failed completely. The HRM was randomly initialized, and it solved the tasks directly from inputs without chain of thoughts.}
