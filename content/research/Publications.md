**Blurb:**
This study explores how the influenza virus protein NS1 affects the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in cells. Researchers found that NS1 can both inhibit and enhance ENaC function depending on the timing of its expression, suggesting a complex role for NS1 in regulating ion channels during infection. These findings provide new insights into how influenza may impact lung function at the cellular level.
