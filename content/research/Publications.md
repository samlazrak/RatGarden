## Influenza NS1 protein differentially modulates the trafficking and function of the epithelial sodium channel

**Publication:** [FASEB Journal Abstract (2019)](https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.549.5)

**My Role:** As a research assistant in Dr. Ahmed Lazrak's laboratory at UAB, I conducted key experiments investigating the molecular mechanisms of NS1-ENaC interactions. My contributions included cell culture maintenance, protein expression analysis, and electrophysiological measurements that helped establish the biphasic nature of NS1's effect on ENaC function.

**Summary:**
This study explores how the influenza virus protein NS1 affects the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in cells. We discovered that NS1 can both inhibit and enhance ENaC function depending on the timing of its expression, suggesting a complex role for NS1 in regulating ion channels during infection. These findings provide new insights into how influenza may impact lung function at the cellular level and could inform future therapeutic approaches for managing flu-related respiratory complications.
