# Research

This section contains my academic research work, publications, and ongoing studies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, medicine, and biomedical engineering.

## Current Research Focus

My primary research interest lies in developing AI applications for healthcare, building on my background in biomedical research and software engineering. This includes:

- **Clinical Decision Support Systems**: AI-powered tools to assist healthcare providers in diagnosis and treatment planning
- **Medical Imaging Analysis**: Deep learning models for automated interpretation of medical scans
- **Privacy-Preserving Healthcare AI**: Local AI systems that maintain patient privacy while providing clinical value
- **Predictive Medicine**: Machine learning models for disease risk assessment and outcome prediction

## Academic Background

- **Computer Science** (UAB, 2016-2025): Technical foundation for AI development and computational thinking
- **Philosophy** (UAB, 2021-2025): Critical thinking skills and ethical reasoning for responsible AI development
- **Biomedical Research Experience** (UAB, 2016-2022): Hands-on laboratory experience with electrophysiology, protein analysis, and data interpretation

## Research Methodology

My approach combines:

- Rigorous computational methods with clinical validation
- Ethical considerations from philosophical training
- Practical software engineering skills for real-world implementation
- Interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science and medicine
