laboratory at UAB, I conducted key experiments investigating the molecular mechanisms of NS1-ENaC interactions. My contributions included cell culture maintenance, protein expression analysis, and electrophysiological measurements that helped establish the biphasic nature of NS1's effect on ENaC function.Summary:\nThis study explores how the influenza virus protein NS1 affects the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in cells. We discovered that NS1 can both inhibit and enhance ENaC function depending on the timing of its expression, suggesting a complex role for NS1 in regulating ion channels during infection. These findings provide new insights into how influenza may impact lung function at the cellular level and could inform future therapeutic approaches for managing flu-related respiratory complications.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#publication","#research","#science","#influenza","#ENaC","#NS1","#journal"],"headers":[{"heading":"Publications","level":1,"id":"Publications_1"},{"heading":"Influenza NS1 protein differentially modulates the trafficking and function of the epithelial sodium channel","level":2,"id":"Influenza_NS1_protein_differentially_modulates_the_trafficking_and_function_of_the_epithelial_sodium_channel_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"publications.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753576027896,"modifiedTime":1753593045025,"sourceSize":1247,"sourcePath":"Publications.md","exportPath":"publications.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":4,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"resume.html":{"title":"Resume","icon":"","description":"Tags: <a href=\".?query=tag:resume\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#resume\">#resume</a> <a href=\".?query=tag:medical-ai\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#medical-ai\">#medical-ai</a> <a href=\".?query=tag:healthcare\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#healthcare\">#healthcare</a> <a href=\".?query=tag:optimized\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#optimized\">#optimized</a> <a href=\".?query=tag:ai-integration\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#ai-integration\">#ai-integration</a>Software Engineer | Full-Stack (C#, .NET, Java, Guidewire) | FinTech/Defense | Implementing and pushing AI features to production in existing software | 5+ YOE | Passionate about building Tech groups in Birmingham, AL\n<br>Email: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"mailto:samlazrak130@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\">samlazrak130@gmail.com</a> Phone: 205-413-5264\n<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"linkedin.com/in/samlazrak\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Linkedin</a> <br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"github.com/samlazrak\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Github</a> <br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"garden.samlazrak.com\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Digital Garden</a>\nSoftware Engineer with 5 years building production systems in regulated environments (financial services, defense).
