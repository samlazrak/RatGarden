My contributions included cell culture maintenance, protein expression analysis, and electrophysiological measurements that helped establish the biphasic nature of NS1's effect on ENaC function.Summary:
This study explores how the influenza virus protein NS1 affects the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in cells. We discovered that NS1 can both inhibit and enhance ENaC function depending on the timing of its expression, suggesting a complex role for NS1 in regulating ion channels during infection. These findings provide new insights into how influenza may impact lung function at the cellular level and could inform future therapeutic approaches for managing flu-related respiratory complications.]]></description><link>publications.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Publications.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 05:10:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to The Rat's Garden]]></title><description><![CDATA[A digital garden exploring AI, medicine, art, and technology through the lens of research and creativity.]]></description><link>index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">index.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 01:09:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[AI Features Showcase]]></title><description><![CDATA[Comprehensive overview of AI-powered features in The Rat's Garden]]></description><link>garden-ai-features-showcase.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Garden AI features showcase.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 18:29:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[map]]></title><link>map.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">map.json</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 11:21:36 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
