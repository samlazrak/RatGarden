# CLAUDE.md - Single Source of Truth

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ðŸ§  Core Development Principles

**KEY PRINCIPLES**:

1. **Use sub-agents** for specialized tasks
2. **Separate planning from implementation**

## ðŸ§  Core Efficiency Principle: Planning vs Implementation Separation

**OPTIMAL APPROACH**:

- **Planning Phase**: Strategy, analysis, pattern identification, requirements gathering
- **Implementation Phase**: Coding, technical execution, debugging, file operations
- **Result**: Maximum efficiency - planning is cheaper, implementation is more expensive

**When to Use Each**:

- **Use planning for**: Strategy, analysis, pattern identification
- **Use implementation for**: Coding, technical execution
- **Avoid**: Doing implementation work during planning phase

- **Layout**: `quartz.layout.ts` defines component placement and page layouts
- **Components**: Preact components in `quartz/components/` for UI elements
- **Plugins**: Modular system in `quartz/plugins/` for transformers, filters, and emitters

### Key Components

## Development Workflow

1. **Content Development**: Edit content in `content/` directory (or `private/content/` for private content)
2. **Start Development**: Run `npm run dev` for standard development or `npm run dev-with-private` to include private content
3. **Hot Reload**: Changes to content trigger automatic rebuild and browser refresh via WebSocket
4. **Configuration Changes**: Require server restart - use `npm run kill` then restart
5. **Port Management**: Use `npm run serve-auto` for automatic port detection if 8080 is busy
6. **Testing**: Run `npm run test` for unit tests, `npm run test:coverage` for coverage reports
7. **Quality Checks**: Use `npm run check` for TypeScript and Prettier validation

## Code Style & Standards

- Use TypeScript with strict type checking for ALL new code
- Use Preact instead of React for all components
- Follow existing code patterns and file organization
- Use SCSS for styling with CSS custom properties
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all new code
- **NEVER create JavaScript files - always use TypeScript (.ts/.tsx)**
- Convert any existing JavaScript files to TypeScript when modifying them

## File Organization

- Components: `quartz/components/` with styles in `quartz/components/styles/`
- Scripts: `quartz/components/scripts/` for inline scripts
- Content: `content/` directory with appropriate subdirectories
- Tests: `tests/` directory or alongside components with `__tests__` folders
- Documentation: `docs/` directory for project documentation (NOT CLAUDE.md)
- Utility Scripts: `scripts/` directory for build and maintenance scripts
- **CLAUDE.md must remain in the root directory** - do not move it to docs/

## Repository Structure

### Private vs Public Content
- **Private Repository**: Contains all content, build artifacts, and development files
- **Public Repository**: Source code only - no content, build artifacts, or private files
- **Content Separation**: `content/` for public content, `private/content/` for private content
- **Sanitization**: Comprehensive sanitization system in `scripts/sanitize/` removes sensitive content
- **Testing**: `npm run test-sanitization` validates sanitization rules before applying

### File Management
- **Git LFS**: Large files (videos, images, JSON embeddings) handled by Git LFS
- **Build Artifacts**: All build outputs excluded from git via .gitignore
- **Cache Management**: Semantic cache and embeddings managed separately

## Git Operations - STRICT RULES

- **NEVER make git commits automatically** - only suggest commits to the user
- **NEVER push code automatically** - only suggest pushes to the user
- **NEVER run git commands without explicit user approval**
- **NEVER use sanitization scripts without user approval**
- **ALWAYS ask for permission before any git operations**
- **ONLY suggest changes and let the user execute them manually**
- **If git operations are needed, provide the exact commands for the user to run**

## Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests first (TDD)
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Validate all user inputs
- Mock external dependencies
- Test happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions
- Use Vitest with happy-dom for component testing
- Achieve good test coverage (aim for 80%+)

## Linter Error Handling

- **Maximum 3 attempts** to fix linter errors on the same file
- If linter errors persist after 3 attempts, stop and ask the user for guidance
- Do not make uneducated guesses and do not loop more than 3 times to fix linter errors on the same file
- Focus on clear, obvious fixes rather than complex type system changes
- When hitting the limit, provide a summary of the remaining issues to the user

## Important Implementation Details

### Framework Choices
- **Preact over React**: Smaller bundle size and better performance
- **esbuild**: Fast compilation with Lightning CSS for optimized styling
- **TypeScript Strict**: All new code must use TypeScript with strict type checking

### Build Process
- **Graph Links**: Hybrid graph link generation runs before each build for connectivity
- **Hot Reload**: WebSocket-based hot reload for content and component changes
- **Parallel Processing**: Workerpool for CPU-intensive tasks like embeddings
- **Caching**: Semantic cache system for faster subsequent builds

### Deployment
- **Production**: Deployed at garden.samlazrak.com via Netlify
- **Functions**: Serverless functions in `netlify/functions/` for AI features
- **Static Assets**: Optimized asset handling with custom emitters

### Performance Optimizations
- **Client-side AI**: TensorFlow.js for semantic search without server round-trips
- **Canvas Rendering**: Pixi.js for efficient interactive graphics
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and AI features load on demand
- **Code Splitting**: Modular architecture for optimal loading

## Sub-Agent Usage

### Available Sub-Agents

- **content-curator**: Content strategy and gap analysis
- **semantic-link-optimizer**: Content connectivity optimization
- **medical-content-assistant**: Medical terminology validation
- **test-generator**: Automated test creation
- **privacy-auditor**: Privacy and security review
- **unit-test-engineer**: Comprehensive test suite creation
- **code-reviewer**: Code review and best practices
- **software-architecture-expert**: System design and architecture
- **ai-ml-engineer-mentor**: AI/ML implementation guidance
- **professional-writer-career-advisor**: Technical writing and documentation
- **natural-writing-humanizer**: Content personalization

### When to Use Sub-Agents

- **Content Projects**: content-curator + semantic-link-optimizer
- **Code Review**: code-reviewer + test-generator
- **Architecture**: software-architecture-expert
- **Medical Content**: medical-content-assistant
- **AI Features**: ai-ml-engineer-mentor
- **Testing**: unit-test-engineer
- **Privacy**: privacy-auditor

### Sub-Agent Efficiency

- **Batch multiple agents** in single query when possible
- **Skip agents** for simple tasks (low ROI)
- **Use for specialized work** only

## Knowledge Base Integration

### Local Knowledge Base

- **Database**: `~/.claude-knowledge/db/claude-knowledge.db` for contexts and solutions
- **Purpose**: Gather intelligence to help Claude use fewer tokens
- **Usage**: Search before implementing, save patterns after success

### Essential Scripts (`.claude-scripts/`)

- **save-context.sh**: Save project context to database
- **load-context.sh**: Load previous project context
- **track-tokens.sh**: Track token usage for efficiency analysis

### Templates (`.claude-templates/`)

- **React/Preact**: `.claude-templates/react/component.tsx`
- **Python**: `.claude-templates/python/class.py`
- **Node.js**: `.claude-templates/node/component.js`

## Efficiency Targets

- **Minimum 25% token savings** through optimization
- **90% pattern reuse** for common tasks
- **80% sub-agent utilization** for specialized work
- **100% planning/implementation separation**

## Warning System

**WARN USER** if they violate efficiency principles:

- Creating new patterns when templates exist
- Not using sub-agents for specialized tasks
- Breaking related tasks into separate queries
- Ignoring documented solutions
- **Not separating planning from implementation**

**REMEMBER**: Every token saved is value preserved for future high-impact work. Efficiency is mandatory for maximum subscription value. The planning/implementation separation is key to maximum efficiency.
